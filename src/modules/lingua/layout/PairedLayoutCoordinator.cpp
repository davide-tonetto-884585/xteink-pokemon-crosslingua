// lineHeight per row. Both columns stamp the original paragraph's index
// (bufferedOriginalParagraphIdx) so the Page Translation overlay's line->paragraph mapping still
// resolves. RTL is handled per-word inside each half-width line by layoutAndExtractLines.
//
// SOURCE vs LEFT: today the source is the physically left column and the translation the right one,
// but the two are NOT the same thing and the code below never treats them as such. Everything
// keyed to the content — the footnote drain, the block style, the paragraph index — follows the
// SOURCE stream by name; only sourceColX / transColX are physical. A future column-order setting
// then only has to swap those two x values.
